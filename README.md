# alternate-side-bot

Alternate Side Bot is a Twitter bot that retweets any time alternate side parking rules are suspended in NYC.

You can follow [@AlterSideBot](https://twitter.com/AlterSideBot), instead of the city's [@NYCASP](https://twitter.com/NYCASP) if you  want to get notified on the status of ASP only on the days the ASP rules are suspended instead of every single day.
